# Introduction

This project started in 2015 summer as side-project when I was 18 years old. The indent was to disrupt certain niche vertical market with static website creator.

More than 2 years later, I deem this project as commercial failure in over-saturated market and thus make this product public as I have other projects to pursue.

Many mistakes were made in both business and development sense as I was the only one developing and designing this. Some of these mistakes were:
1) Hunting perfectionism - I cannot tell how many times I felt that this product was not ready for public. Thinking back, I was wrong. It was, I was just hunting perfectionism: trying to write perfect code, use latest technology, implement certain new features, and so on. I would say release MVP as soon as possible so you can actually implement features that users want, not what you think they want.
2) Timing is everything - at that time, when I started writing first line of this product, there was perhaps few such products but they all sucked at the niche I was targeting. Due "hunting perfectionism", the product release was delayed for 1.5 years (I am serious) and thus I was late to the game.

Of-course there are many other mistakes but I think these two are most important takeaways.

The code was written back in 2015 and I am glad that I choose React with Redux that time as this project shows. Of-course there are many things I would do differently and in better way when I would start again, but I am overall happy how it turned out except for stylings which are quite horrible. I would definetly use CSS modules as that would make code much understandable.

I hope this project (~30k LOC) shows what you can create with React and Redux and both inspires and show what kind of code not to write.

Cheers!
